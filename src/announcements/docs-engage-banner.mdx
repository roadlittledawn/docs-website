# Edit a doc! File an issue!

We've gone fully open source! That means you can collaborate directly with the folks that work on docs.newrelic.com. 

See a doc that could use some love? Let us know by filing an issue or editing the page yourself. It's easy - just click the **Create issue** or **Edit page** button on the doc to get started!
