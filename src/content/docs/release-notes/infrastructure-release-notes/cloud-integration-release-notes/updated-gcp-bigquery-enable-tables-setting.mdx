### Update

* A new setting **Enable table metrics** has been added in the [Google BigQuery monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/gcp-integrations-list/google-bigquery-monitoring-integration/#table-metrics), disabled by default for new integrations.
* It will be kept enabled for integrations that had the BigQuery integration enabled before the change.
* When disabled BigQuery table entities and their metrics will not be collected.
