title: 'Optimizations when detecting too many new resources'
subject: Cloud integrations
releaseDate: '2022-03-21'

### Update

* All polling integrations for AWS, Azure, and GCP have been optimized to ensure metrics for existing entities are not impacted when large amount of resources are detected from new or existing provider accounts in a short-period of time. Metrics for new resources will be processed according to New Relic [system limits](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits), and may not be ingested until the associated entity is registered.
* AWS CloudWatch metric streams integration has been optimized to ensure resource metrics are always ingested as soon as received. When large amount of new resources are detected in a short-period of time, the associated entity and metadata will be available as soon as the entity is registered.
