### Bug fixes

Sometimes our log forwarding functionality for [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](/docs/logs/forward-logs/stream-logs-using-kinesis-data-firehose) was prepending attributes with `logEvent`. For example, in some AWS logs you might see `logEvent.message`, `logEvent.timestamp`, etc. This prevented default JSON parsing and also applied the ingestion time rather than the timestamp. This bug has been fixed.
