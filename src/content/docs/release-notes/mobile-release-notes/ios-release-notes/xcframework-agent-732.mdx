### Support statement

* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. The iOS and tvOS agents were deprecated with the release of version 7.1.0 of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/xcframework-agent-710) agent. As of this release, the oldest supported version is 7.1.0 of the [XCFramework](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-710)
