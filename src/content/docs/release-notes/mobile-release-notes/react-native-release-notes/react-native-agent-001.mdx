## The Mobile agent team is proud to announce GA support for React Native!

## What is React Native?

React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework, designed for building apps on multiple platforms like iOS and Android and utilizing a single code base. It is based on React, and it brings all its glory to mobile app development.

## Features

* Capture JavaScript errors
* Network instrumentation
* Distributed tracing
* Tracking console log, warn, and error
* Promise rejection tracking
* Capture interactions and the sequence in which they were created
* Pass user information to New Relic to track user sessions
* Expo Support (Bare Workflow and Managed Workflow)
