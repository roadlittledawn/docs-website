New Relic now gives you full visibility into your workloads and infrastructure running on [Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/announcing-general-availability-of-bottlerocket/), including [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) and [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Bottlerocket is a new Linux-based OS by AWS that has been specifically built to run containers.

It has been designed to lower operational costs and management complexity. Bottlerocket does this by reducing its footprint around whatâ€™s needed to run containers while improving security with automatic OS updates.
