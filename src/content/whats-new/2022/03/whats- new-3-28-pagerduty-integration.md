New Relic One now offers two ways to integrate with PagerDuty:
* Account-level integration using REST API Keys (recommended): The integration is fully automatic and supports two-way sync and the ability to define multiple PagerDuty services on a single New Relic destination.
* Service level integration using Events API keys: The single service integration uses the service level integration key, and requires a separate New Relic destination for each unique PagerDuty service.
