We've partnered with [Zebrium](https://zebrium.com/newrelic) to help you automate the process of finding the root cause of issues in logs. When a software or infrastructure problem occurs, Zebrium Root Cause as a Service will quickly and accurately find the root cause indicators so your teams don't need to manually search through all their logs. With this integration, you can also see details of the root cause on any New Relic dashboard page alongside your telemetry data.
