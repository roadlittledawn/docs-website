Starting on July 21, 2022, when you update to one of our latest **Node.js** or **Python** agents, you will also automatically collect and forward logs to New Relic. Previously released for **Java**, **.NET**, and **Ruby** agents, enabling logs in context in a single deployment helps you identify root causes faster with the logs you need surfaced automatically alongside other relevant telemetry dataâ€”without a dedicated log forwarder or lengthy manual configurations. 

**Collecting application logs means that more data will be ingested into the platform and could impact your data ingest costs. Application logs in APM are only available after an APM agent update and are enabled by default. You will see no changes until you update your agent.**

Remember, you always have direct control over which data you send to New Relic. For more information on how to adjust the default setting, see our documentation about [disabling automatic logging](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging/).
