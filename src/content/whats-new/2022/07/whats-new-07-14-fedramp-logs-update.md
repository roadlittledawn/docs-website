On August 12th, 2022, accounts approved under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) currently using one of our [supported APM Agents](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context#agents) will automatically start collecting and forwarding logs to New Relic. This provides you with the logs you need to troubleshoot issues faster, making your telemetry data more valuable without the need for forwarders or custom solutions.

Collecting application logs means that more data will be ingested into the platform, at your standard ingest rate. You always have direct control over which data you send to New Relic by [configuring your agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context/#agents).

See our documentation about [disabling automatic logging](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging/) or [New Relic's data management hub](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data/) for more information on how to adjust your default settings.
