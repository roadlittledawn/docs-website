At New Relic, security is our priority. This is why, effective February 1, 2023, at 16:00 UTC, we'll update our [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) requirements for all inbound connections to a minimum TLS version of 1.2.

**If you're already using TLS 1.2 or above, you won't be impacted.**

To avoid interruptions on your data, upgrade to an operating system and/or TLS stack that supports TLS 1.2 or above. To ensure TLS 1.2 compatibility, please work closely with your IT and security teams on creating a migration plan.
