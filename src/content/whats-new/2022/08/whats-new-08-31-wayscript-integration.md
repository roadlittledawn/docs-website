## Connect self-serve developer environments with full stack observability
We've partnered with [WayScript](https://wayscript.com) to build an integration that lets you quickly create a developer environment and automatically monitor it with a suite of observability tools. 

This integration lets you:
- **Instantly spin up containerized developer environments** in a single click.
- **Host full-fledged apps, set up internal microservices, and more**, with built-in tools like a terminal and IDE.
- **Monitor and troubleshoot everything you build** with an easy connection to the New Relic observability platform.
