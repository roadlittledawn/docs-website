Ruby Engineers can now access CodeStream’s instant observability features all the way down to the method-level, enabling you to optimize app performance and resolve errors faster.

This update lets you: 
* **Easily access the golden signals** alongside the code that you’re working on with **Code-level metrics** and click-through to the APM service summary page on New Relic to get more insight.
* **Monitor overall performance** with **Service-level telemetry**, which surfaces the golden signals for the services associated with the repo you have open in your IDE. With just a click you can also see the metrics for any service that calls, or is called by, your service.
