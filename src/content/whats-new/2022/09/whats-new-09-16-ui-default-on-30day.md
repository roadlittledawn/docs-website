At New Relic, we believe that every engineer needs intuitive access to telemetry data, which is why we’re launching a [redesigned UI](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/new-ui-new-relic) on October 17, 2022. And we’re making it easy to upgrade: All users* will default to the new UI automatically, but don’t worry–you can still [switch back](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/new-navigation-transition-guide/#on) to the old UI by navigating to your account settings menu and toggling **New design** to **Off**.

_* If you’ve already tried the new interface and switched back to the old design, you won’t be affected by this change._

**Why are we doing this?**

With the new UI, you can now get to the root cause of issues faster and instrument your systems with a customizable navigation that’s relevant to your workflow. 

**What’s changing?**

The enhanced user interface includes:
* **Intuitive navigation**: Get to your data faster with simple and consistent navigation across the entire platform.
* **Full customization**: Personalize your navbar by pinning and unpinning features that are relevant to you.
* **Easier instrumentation**: Immediately access onboarding flows that help you make the most of your data.
* **More data at-a-glance**: Get instant visibility of all your services in one place. 

To try the new UI now, navigate to your account menu and toggle **New design** to **On**.
