As a .NET engineer, you can now access CodeStream’s instant observability features all the way down to the method-level, enabling you to optimize app performance and resolve errors faster. By updating your .NET agent to [v.9.9.0.0 or higher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/installation/update-net-agent/) you can access code-level metrics, letting you see the golden signals alongside the code you’re working on. Additionally, you can now get the bigger picture with service-level telemetry, which surfaces telemetry data including throughput, error rate, and response rate for services associated with the repo you have open in your IDE, as well as the services it is called by.


This update lets you: 
* **Easily access the golden signals** alongside the code that you’re working on with code-level metrics and click through to the APM service summary page on New Relic to get more insight.
* **Monitor overall performance** with service-level telemetry, which surfaces the golden signals for the services associated with the repo you have open in your IDE. With just a click you can see the metrics for any service that calls, or is called by, your service.

Watch this demo video to learn how to set up access to golden signals in your IDE with CodeStream:
