You can now query a user's name, user ID, user type, email, and last active date with our NerdGraph API. You can also update a user's user type and email address.

[NerdGraph](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) is our [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. It is an open-source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching.
