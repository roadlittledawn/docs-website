#  Streaming data export allows you to stream data out of New Relic for deeper data exploration as well as for compliance and security 

Today, [Data Plus](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2022/06/whats-new-6-1-data-plus-available) customers can stream data out of New Relic (as it is being ingested) for compliance, security, and deeper data analysis. This is done through AWS Kinesis Firehose via NerdGraph. Using NerdGraph queries, you can create and manage streaming rules that determine what sort of data will be exported in real time. As this data is only exported during [ingestion](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic), it differs from [historical data export](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2022/09/whats-new-9-14-historical-data-exports) which reports past data, not data currently being ingested.  

In addition, Data Plus also includes:

* Up to 90 days of data retention across all data types
* FedRAMP authorized
* HIPAA compliance with HITRUST certification (Pro and Enterprise customers only) 
* Logs obfuscation
* Historical data export
* Vulnerability management
* Cloud provider choice (Q1 2023)
