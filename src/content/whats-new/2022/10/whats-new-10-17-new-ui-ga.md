Starting today, New Relic is launching a fresh, new look for all our users! Experience our simplified user interface that makes it easier for you to navigate the platform and take advantage of all the awesome features. 

Don't worry, you can still switch back to the old UI by heading to your account settings menu and toggling **New design** to **Off**. If you’ve already tried the new interface and switched back to the old design, you aren’t affected by today’s change.

With the new interface you can:
* **Solve problems quicker** with simple and intuitive navigation.
* **Increase efficiency** by customizing your experience and pinning and unpinning features that are relevant to you.
* **Make the most out of your data** by ingesting new data sources with easy access to hundreds of onboarding flows.
