Starting on November 3rd, 2022, when you update to our latest **Go** or **PHP** agents, you'll also automatically collect and forward logs to New Relic, joining the previously released **Java**, **.NET**,  **Ruby**, **Node.js**, and **Python** agents that now include logs-in-context in a single deployment, without a dedicated log forwarder or lengthy manual configurations. This lets you easily take advantage of our improved UI that surfaces the logs you need alongside other relevant telemetry data to help you identify the root cause of issues faster.

* **Collecting application logs means that more data will be ingested into the platform. Application logs in APM are only available after an APM agent update and are enabled by default. Until you update your agent, you will see no changes.**

Remember, you always have direct control over which data you send to New Relic. For more on how to adjust the default setting, see [our docs on disabling logging](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging).
