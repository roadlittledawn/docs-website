[Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) helps you securely deliver content with low latency and high transfer speeds by utilizing the purpose-built and feature-rich AWS global network. By integrating your Amazon CloudFront access logs with New Relic, you can track important performance metrics including error rates, request counts, and uploaded/downloaded bytes. 

The [Amazon CloudFront quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/amazon-cloudfront-web-logs) lets you easily explore your data to resolve CDN-related issues faster in New Relic with a pre-built dashboard that visualizes CDN performance and client information.

To enable this integration, see [how to connect AWS services to New Relic](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring/). There are two options for sending logs from Amazon CloudFront: [standard logging (access logs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html), and [real-time logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html). Find more information for both options in our [CloudFront web logs docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/cloudfront-web-logs/).

## Using another CDN?

Weâ€™ve also partnered with leading CDN providers Akamai, Cloudflare, and Fastly to create quickstarts that bundle integration instructions, pre-built dashboards, and alerts to help you start monitoring your CDN's performance in a matter of minutes. Learn more about how you can keep tabs on business-vital performance indicators such as load balancing, latency, availability, and other information in the context of all your telemetry data [in our blog](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/integrations-cdn-monitoring).
