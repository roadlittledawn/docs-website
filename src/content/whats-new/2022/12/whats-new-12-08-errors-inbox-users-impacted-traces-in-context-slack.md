You need rich, contextual data to ensure that you’re prioritizing and resolving the most mission critical errors quickly. Errors inbox has released a set of features that provide much-needed context to accelerate your error resolution workflows. 

These enhancements include: 
* **Users Impacted & Alerting:** Get insights into how many users are encountering a particular error group. You can also create incremental alerts based on this metric, enabling more effective prioritization.
* **Traces in Context:** You can now correlate traces to error instances, enabling deeper analysis within a single pane of glass. 
* **Updated Slack functionality:** We’ve updated our Slack integrations so that you can discuss and collaborate on different error groups at the entity level.
