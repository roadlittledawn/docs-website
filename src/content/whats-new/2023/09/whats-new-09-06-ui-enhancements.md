Discover enhanced search, customizable shortcuts, and collapsible second-level navigation in our latest UI enhancements. These updates allow you to navigate the platform with precision, save time, and gain critical insights for peak system performance and reduced MTTR.

With our new UI enhancements, you can:

- **Find what you need faster and more easily** with our improved search functionality – now called Quick Find – to search for capabilities and view your recently visited entities.
- **Navigate more efficiently** with our new global keyboard shortcuts, allowing you to complete tasks with fewer clicks.
- **Maximize your ability to view critical data points** by collapsing the redesigned second-level navigation bars, removing distractions and freeing up valuable screen real estate.
