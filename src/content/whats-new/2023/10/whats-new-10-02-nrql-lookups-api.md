Our new NRQL Lookups API lets you automate lookup table maintenance through a REST API. In addition to uploading CSV formatted files, tables can now be defined directly in a JSON payload - facilitating the management of lookup tables.

Following the NRQL Lookups feature release, users could only perform lookup table maintenance via the Lookups tables UI. We realize that manually updating a lookup table through the UI each morning is not realistic, and are pleased to offer automation for this critical process.

Check out the [NRQL Lookups API documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/lookups-service-api/lookups-service-api) for more details.
