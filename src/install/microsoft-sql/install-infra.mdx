headingText: Install the infrastructure agent
---

To use the Microsoft SQL Server integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/choose-infra-install-method) on a Linux or Windows host, or on a host capable of remotely accessing Microsoft SQL Server. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Microsoft SQL Server-specific data.

<Callout variant="important">
    If using a gMSA for SQL Server access, then the infrastructure agent needs to run as the gMSA.
