You can edit the `mysql-config.yml` configuration file, which is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected, to match your setup and preferences. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like `interval`, `timeout`, or `inventory_source`.

To read all about these common settings refer to our [configuration format standards](/docs/create-integrations/infrastructure-integrations-sdk/specifications/host-integrations-newer-configuration-format/#configuration-basics).
