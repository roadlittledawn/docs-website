Now that you've installed the Python agent, you are ready to see data in New Relic:

1. Restart your application server or your non-web application/service.
2. Exercise your app so New Relic can capture some telemetry data.
3. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services**.
4. Click your entity (service) that has the same app name you provided in the configuration (keep in mind it can take a few minutes before your entity appears in the UI).
5. Look at basic details on the **Summary** page and check out other telemetry related to your app.
